                    I am current 4th-year student at the University of St. Thomas, Minnesota - graduating in May 2022. Passionate about making the world a better place. I have loved technology from a young age and I still love engaging with technology that makes everyday life easier. I am both excited and a 'healthy amount' of nervous to begin my career as a developer after graduating this Spring.

                        There seems to be a higher crime rate in neighborhoods that contain retail hot spots such as the Capitol/River neighborhood.

                        Looking at the crimes per neighborhood it was apparent that Thomas/Dale(Frogtown) had the highest number of incidents in the data.

                    I am a senior at University of St. Thomas. Over the past 4 years, I had the ability to experience this school to its fullest.
                I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Analytics. I believe pairing these two fields together will give me a broad range of jobs that I will be able to do and succeed at.
